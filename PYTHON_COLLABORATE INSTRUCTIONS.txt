1. PyCharm > Settings
    Version Control
        GitHub: use the add feature to include your GitHub account - need user email / ID and pswd

2. GitHub Project Repository URL: https://github.com/bleichnitz/LPN

3. On Startup Window with projects, select New Project from VCS.
    Since you have previously logged in you should see the project names available to you on GitHub.
    Looking for "LPN" >>> short for Learning Progression Notebook.

4. Once the files load, create a localized interpreter and virtual environment.
    > bottom R of screen in status bar you should see the row/char count, line separator mode, UTF-8, indent
    configuration set to 4 spaces and then the INTERPRETER space followed by the git branch
    > interpreter likely to say something like "<<no interpreter>>"
    > select to add new interpreter
    > select python version to current Python 3.11 (updated 2023-01-15)

5. Add python modules via the terminal.
    See the "PYTHON_PKG_LIST.txt" for all modules added to the project.

6. Create your run configurations for this computer.
    > top R of menu bar
    > look for the Python symbol w/dropdown button
    > create new configuration

7. In the main.py insert the directory for the computer you are currently working on into the CMD_LINE function
to test the program.
    NOTE: this will need to be changed for each time you pull updated code as the last person update the
    program will have the directory set to their personal machine.
